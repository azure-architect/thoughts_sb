 I have an idea that I would like to take and I would like to pull the 66 different steps from an idea. Do text file or whatever I choose to use as as a method for inputting an idea I have and then I wanted to run through those six steps like we out, but I kinda want to be able to be branched off from there maybe even on each step like when a step is done something it's updated or something gets branched off handed off to another crew like a fork so if my idea comes through, and it's in a piece of text and it hits the inbox, I want the inbox to be the point of the beginning of a ton of stuff and at some point, you know I wanna take that idea when it's automatic correctly as a Jason thing I'm a jig and I wanna pass it off to a new crew and I want that crew to create Instagram post well first of all create a work article and then from there an Instagram post and from there YouTube short, an Instagram video sh and I want it all to be branched off and used 100 times over I mean I want that data to go all over the place I wanted in a database I want all kinds of stuff to be triggered off just by the thought of an idea going into the inbox
